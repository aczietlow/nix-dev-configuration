# Local Dev Setup

Ye be warned, beyobd the threshold, there be dragons and madness

This is my personal flavor of development setup

## Project Setup

Legacy: run OS specific bash scripts to automate the installation and configuration process

zsh - zsh specific settings
scripts/ -  local scripts meant to be reused
mac/ - [legacy] location for all mac specific installation
